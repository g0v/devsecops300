# docker compose up

```sh
sh setup.sh | tee docker-compose.yaml && docker compose up -d
sh setup.sh | docker compose -f - up -d
sh setup.sh | tee docker-compose.yaml | docker compose -f - up -d
curl -sL https://example.com/scripts/setup.sh | docker compose -f - up -d
```

Here's the updated explanation:

**Command 1: `sh setup.sh | tee docker-compose.yaml && docker compose up -d`**

* `sh setup.sh` runs the `setup.sh` script, which likely generates some output.
* `tee docker-compose.yaml` takes the output of the script and writes it to a file named `docker-compose.yaml`. The `tee` command also prints the output to the console.
* `&&` is a logical AND operator, which means the second command will only run if the first command succeeds.
* `docker compose up -d` starts the Docker containers in detached mode (-d) using the `docker-compose.yaml` file generated by the script.

Network I/O: None (since it's a local script execution)
Filesystem I/O: Writes to `docker-compose.yaml` file

**Command 2: `sh setup.sh | docker compose -f - up -d`**

* `sh setup.sh` runs the `setup.sh` script, which generates some output.
* `docker compose -f - up -d` takes the output of the script as the configuration file (due to the `-f -` option) and starts the Docker containers in detached mode (-d).

Network I/O: None (since it's a local script execution)
Filesystem I/O: None (no file is written)

**Command 3: `sh setup.sh | tee docker-compose.yaml | docker compose -f - up -d`**

* `sh setup.sh` runs the `setup.sh` script, which generates some output.
* `tee docker-compose.yaml` takes the output of the script and writes it to a file named `docker-compose.yaml`. The `tee` command also prints the output to the console.
* `docker compose -f - up -d` takes the output of the script (which is the same as the contents of `docker-compose.yaml`) as the configuration file and starts the Docker containers in detached mode (-d).

Network I/O: None (since it's a local script execution)
Filesystem I/O: Writes to `docker-compose.yaml` file

**Command 4: `curl -sL https://example.com/scripts/setup.sh | docker compose -f - up -d`**

* `curl -sL https://example.com/scripts/setup.sh` downloads the `setup.sh` script from the specified URL and executes it.
* The output of the script is piped to `docker compose -f - up -d`, which takes the output as the configuration file and starts the Docker containers in detached mode (-d).

Network I/O: Downloads the script from the specified URL
Filesystem I/O: None (no file is written)

**Important Note:** After running Command 2, 4, if you try to run `docker compose down`, it will fail because there is no `docker-compose.yaml` file in the filesystem. This is because the script output was not written to a file, and the `docker compose` command only received the output as a stream.

To avoid this issue, you can modify Command 4 to write the output to a file, like this:
```bash
curl -sL https://example.com/scripts/setup.sh | tee docker-compose.yaml | docker compose -f - up -d
```
This way, the `docker-compose.yaml` file will be written to the filesystem, and subsequent `docker compose down` commands will work as expected.

# setup.sh

```sh
#!/bin/sh
DOCKERFILE=$(cat <<"EOOF"
FROM alpine
RUN apk add sqlite
EOF
EOOF
)
IMAGE_NAME=$(uuidgen)
IMAGE_URL=ttl.sh/${IMAGE_NAME}:1h
echo "$DOCKERFILE" | docker build -t ${IMAGE_URL} -f - . > /dev/null
docker push ${IMAGE_URL} > /dev/null
cat <<EOF
services:
  ghost:
    image: ${IMAGE_URL}
EOF
```

Let's break down this shell script step by step:

**Line 1:** `#!/bin/sh` - This is the shebang line, which specifies the interpreter that should be used to run the script. In this case, it's the Bourne shell (`/bin/sh`).

**Lines 2-5:** `DOCKERFILE=$(cat <<"EOOF" ... EOOF)` - This is a here document, which is a way to embed a multi-line string within a script. The `EOOF` delimiter is used to mark the beginning and end of the string. The contents of the string are:
```
FROM alpine
RUN apk add sqlite
```
This is a Dockerfile, which is a recipe for building a Docker image. Specifically, it:

* Uses the `alpine` base image
* Installs the `sqlite` package using `apk` (the package manager for Alpine Linux)

**Line 6:** `IMAGE_NAME=$(uuidgen)` - This line generates a random UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) using the `uuidgen` command and assigns it to the `IMAGE_NAME` variable.

**Line 7:** `IMAGE_URL=ttl.sh/${IMAGE_NAME}:1h` - This line constructs a URL for the Docker image by concatenating the following parts:
	* `ttl.sh/` - a registry URL (likely a temporary URL for testing purposes)
	* `${IMAGE_NAME}` - the random UUID generated earlier
	* `:1h` - a tag indicating that the image should be valid for 1 hour

**Line 8:** `echo "$DOCKERFILE" | docker build -t ${IMAGE_URL} -f - . > /dev/null` - This line builds a Docker image using the Dockerfile contents stored in the `DOCKERFILE` variable. The options used are:
	* `-t ${IMAGE_URL}` - specifies the tag for the image
	* `-f -` - specifies the Dockerfile contents as input (instead of a file)
	* `.` - specifies the current directory as the build context
	* `> /dev/null` - redirects the output to `/dev/null`, effectively suppressing it

**Line 9:** `docker push ${IMAGE_URL} > /dev/null` - This line pushes the built image to the registry specified in the `IMAGE_URL` variable. The output is again redirected to `/dev/null`.

**Lines 10-12:** `cat <<EOF ... EOF` - This is another here document, which outputs a YAML file containing a service definition. The contents are:
```
services:
  ghost:
    image: ${IMAGE_URL}
```
This defines a service named `ghost` that uses the Docker image with the URL constructed earlier.

In summary, this script:

1. Defines a Dockerfile that installs SQLite on an Alpine Linux base image.
2. Generates a random UUID for the image name.
3. Constructs a temporary URL for the image.
4. Builds a Docker image using the Dockerfile contents.
5. Pushes the image to the registry.
6. Outputs a YAML file defining a service that uses the built image.
