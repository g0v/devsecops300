# Why 1940?

> In 1940, Rene Carmille became the first ethical hacker. He was a punch-card computer expert and member of the Resistance in France during the Nazi occupation. He owned the machines that France’s Vichy government used to process information. He discovered that the Nazis were using the machines to track down Jews, so he offered to allow them to use his machine. They took the bait, and he then used that access to hack them and disrupt their efforts.
