# DevSecOps ELI5 Guide from Zero to Hero: The Ultimate Step-by-Step Guide to Building an Invincible Fortress üè∞

Once upon a time in the land of Software, there stood many castles üè∞. Some were big, some were shiny, but not all were safe. In a corner of this land, there was a special kind of castle-building called DevSecOps. It wasn't just about making the castle big or beautiful; it was about making it unbreakable, a fortress without any weak spots where baddies could sneak in.

Now, you might be wondering how you can build such a strong fortress yourself. Well, let's go on a step-by-step adventure to learn the secrets of creating an invincible fortress with DevSecOps!

## Step 1: Gather Your Brave Knights and Wizards

Every good fortress needs a team. In DevSecOps, these are not just builders (developers) or guards (operations staff) but also spellcasters (security experts). All of them need to work together from the very beginning, planning how to make the castle safe even before the first stone is laid.

## Step 2: Draw Your Blueprints Early

When designing your fortress, start thinking about traps and thick walls (security measures) right away. Don't wait until the castle is built to figure out how to keep the dragons (hackers) at bay. This is the "shift-left" approach, and it means building with safety in mind from the start.

## Step 3: Use Magical Tools

In the world of DevSecOps, there are magical tools that help build faster and safer. These tools automatically check for termites (vulnerabilities) and fix them without having to stop and call in extra help. Automation is like having a wizard's spell that continuously repairs and strengthens walls as they are being built.

## Step 4: Keep a Lookout

Set up a crystal ball (monitoring system) that keeps an eye on your fortress all the time. This helps you spot any sneaky goblins trying to dig tunnels or climb over the walls so that you can stop them in their tracks.

## Step 5: Teach Everyone Defense Spells

It's not enough to have a few wizards who know all the spells; every knight in your team should learn basic magic (security practices). Teach them to spot trickery and ward off minor curses on their own.

## Step 6: Constantly Strengthen Your Walls

Over time, winds (technology changes) and rains (new types of attacks) will test your fortress. Make sure you're always fixing any leaks and reinforcing the battlements. This means revisiting your security measures and improving them as needed.

## Step 7: Drill Battle Plans

Even the strongest fortresses can be attacked. That's why you should have a battle plan (incident response plan) for what to do if the castle is breached. Practice this plan regularly with your knights so everyone knows how to respond in case of an emergency.

Building an invincible fortress in the land of DevSecOps is an epic adventure, but it's also a lot of fun! By following these steps, you'll go from a zero to a hero, creating software that is not only amazing but also as safe as the toughest castle in all the realms. And remember, the journey to great castle building never truly ends; every day is a chance to make your fortress even more unbreakable.
