# DevSecOps300

The "DevSecOps300" open-source project presents an all-encompassing DevSecOps Guidebook, crafted to equip developers, security experts, and operations staff with the necessary insights and methodologies to embed security fluidly throughout every phase of the software development and deployment continuum. The core functionality and objectives of a DevSecOps Guide Book project are to:

- Educate Users: Offer a thorough understanding of DevSecOps principles, tools, and strategies to various roles involved in the IT infrastructure.
- Standardize Practices: Establish common procedures and best practices for integrating security into DevOps processes.
- Reference Resource: Serve as a go-to manual for teams needing guidance on implementing DevSecOps initiatives.
- Promote a Security Mindset: Ingrain security as a fundamental component of all IT processes and decisions.
- Serve as a Living Document: The guidebook should be regularly updated to reflect new threats, technologies, and methodologies.

User Roles: The guidebook would cater to multiple roles including:

- Developers: To understand secure coding practices and vulnerability management.
- Security Engineers: To learn how to best integrate automated security tooling within CI/CD pipelines.
- Operations Personnel: For insights into secure infrastructure provisioning and management.
- DevSecOps Champions: Individuals who promote and guide the adoption of DevSecOps practices.
- Compliance and Risk Management Teams: For understanding how DevSecOps addresses regulatory requirements.

Content Types: To be effective, the guidebook should contain diverse content types, including but not limited to:

- Best Practices: Secure coding, continuous integration and deployment, automated testing, etc.
- Tools and Technologies: In-depth exploration of DevSecOps tools (like SAST/DAST, IaC, Container Security, etc.).
- Security Policies and Standards: Guides on incorporating security policies and adhering to global and industry-specific standards.
- Case Studies: Real-world examples showcasing successful DevSecOps implementations.
- Tutorials and How-To Guides: Step-by-step instructions for common tasks.
- Reference Materials: Checklists, cheat sheets, and templates.
- Glossary of Terms: Definitions of common terms and acronyms in DevSecOps.

Basic Workflow for Maintaining Content:

- Content Creation and Review:
  - Subject matter experts (SMEs) draft new content or update existing articles.
  - Content is reviewed and vetted by a peer-review team for technical accuracy and clarity.
- Security Validation:
  - Security experts specifically review content for any potential security issues or outdated practices and provide recommendations.
- Editorial Oversight:
  - An editorial team reviews the content for consistency, grammar, and style adherence to ensure readability.
- Publication:
  - Once the content passes all reviews, it is published within the guide book repository or platform.
- Feedback Loop:
  - The community of users, as well as teams within the organization, can contribute feedback, corrections, or request additional content which is then incorporated into the editorial cycle.
- Version Control:
  - All content should be version-controlled, preferably through a tool like Git, allowing for better collaboration, tracking of changes, and rollbacks if necessary.
- Continuous Monitoring and Updating:
  - A schedule for regular review of content is established to ensure that materials remain relevant and accurate given the fast-paced nature of technology and threats.

A DevSecOps Guide Book should be user-friendly, easily accessible, and adaptable to change with the landscape of security threats and DevOps practices. The involvement of the entire IT team in both consuming and contributing to the guidebook can help foster a culture of shared responsibility for security.

# ELI5 DevSecOps

Imagine you're building a super cool toy castle with your friends, and you want to make sure that no one can break into it and take your treasures. You could wait until after you've finished building the castle and then try to put locks and alarms on all the doors and windows. But what if you forget some doors? Or what if the locks don't fit right because they weren't part of the original plan? It'd be a lot of extra work, and the castle might not be as safe as you want it to be.

This is kind of how people used to make software. They would write all the code (build the castle), and then at the end, they would try to make it secure by finding and fixing problems (putting on locks). But often, that led to delays and not-so-safe software.

Enter DevSecOps. Just like it would be smarter for you and your friends to think about the locks and alarms from the start when building your castle, DevSecOps is about thinking about security from the very beginning of making software. It's like everyone agrees to use strong bricks, put the alarms on as they go, and constantly check the doors as they build to make sure they're super secure.

So, with DevSecOps, the people who write the code (developers), the people who make sure the code keeps running smoothly (operations), and the people who know a lot about keeping things safe (security) all work together from the start. They share the responsibility for the castle's safety, making sure that every stage of building it is secure. This way, when the software is finished, it's not just a cool castle – it's a fortress that's tough for invaders (hackers) to break into!

## ELI5 DevOps vs. DevSecOps

Let's go back to the castle playground to see the difference between DevOps and DevSecOps in a fun and simple way.

DevOps: Imagine you're building a castle out of sand with two groups of friends. The first group loves to make big, beautiful towers and walls – let's call them the "builders" (developers). The second group is good at making sure the castle stays up and finds the best spot to build on so the waves won't knock it down – these are the "castle guards" (operations).

In the past, the builders would make the entire castle and then the guards would have to figure out how to keep it from falling. But often, by the time the guards got to do their job, the castle wasn't built in a way that was easy to protect.

DevOps is like all of these friends working together from the very start. They use buckets and shovels (tools and automation) that help them build faster and communicate with walkie-talkies (chat and collaboration tools) so everyone knows what's happening. They plan and build the castle together, which makes it quicker to build, stronger, and less likely to fall down when the tide comes in.

DevSecOps: Now, let’s add another group of friends to the mix – the "lookouts" (security experts). In the old way of doing things, the lookouts would arrive after the castle was built and start pointing out places where crabs could sneak in or where the walls were too weak against the waves.

DevSecOps means inviting the lookouts to play from the start as well. They bring their binoculars (security tools) and compasses (security practices) to help everyone spot potential problems early, like where sneaky crabs might get in (security vulnerabilities). This way, as the castle grows with pretty towers and strong walls, it's also being watched and made safe from crabs, seagulls, and high tides at every step of the way.

To sum it up, while DevOps focuses on builders and castle guards working together to make the castle building process faster and more reliable, DevSecOps adds lookouts into the mix right from the beginning so that everything they build is not only fast and reliable but also safe from beach critters and the elements all the way through the process. It's like a fun day of building the ultimate sand castle, where everyone has a job to do, and they all help each other to make the castle big, strong, and secures.
